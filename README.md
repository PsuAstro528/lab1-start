# Astro 528 Lab 1

## Exercise 1
#### Goal:  Learn the basics of core development tools
For this first exercise, there will be very little coding, because we'll focus on getting used to using git, GitHub, the ICDS-ACI Portal (or your local copy of Julia if you prefer), Julia and the Pluto notebook environment.

Start at the course website where it offers [help getting setup to complete this lab using ICDS-ACI](https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/initial_setup/).  A link that will trigger GitHub Classroom to create your private repository to start from was provided via the first course announcement.  
Once you get a terminal on ACI (or your local machine if you prefer), clone _your_ repository (and not the generic lab1-start).  Then start julia and Pluto, open the Pluto notebook in ex1.jl and start working through ex1.jl.

## Exercise 2
#### Goal:  Experience the perils of floating point arithmetic
From Pluto, work through ex2.jl.

If you're running low on time, **please** quit this exercise early and make sure to **allow yourself 30 minutes for exercise 3 and submitting your repository**.

## Exercise 3
#### Goal:  Reflect on your goals for the semester
- Create a file named goals.md in your repository.
- Using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), create headings for "My Experience" and "My Goals".
- Write one paragraph (1-5 sentances) about your previous programming experience.  Include a working link somewhere in the paragraph.
- Create a bulleted list of 2 or 3 goals for you to work towards during this course.  
- Create a bulleted list of 3-9 specific objectives for you to acheive during this course.  
- Remember to commit the file to your local respository and push it to your github, so it will be included in the pull request you create to submit your assignment.  
- Once you've pushed your code to GitHub, view a rendered version of your file on GitHub to make sure the formatting is as you intended.

## Submit your repository
#### Goal:  Learn how to push your commits to GitHub and create a pull request on GitHub.com
Once you're ready to commit and push your responces, look at the [help on the course website](https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/submitting/) for instructions on commiting, pushing and submiting your work.
